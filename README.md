---

### Update Notifications (POS)

- POS automatically checks for updates every 24 hours.
- Manual check: **Menu → Check for Updates**.
- Updates are checked **only against the current git branch**.
- The update dialog shows **all commits ahead** (commit message + date).
- Dismissed updates will reappear only when a **new commit** is available.
- It only check for updates on the current branch you are on. It will not update in backend.

---

### Project Structure (Modernized)

Key folders in the modernized POS app:

- `frontend/src/posapp/components/pos/` UI split into small, focused components (invoice, items, payments, closing, etc.)
- `frontend/src/posapp/composables/` business logic and state orchestration (invoice, items, payments, offers, offline)
- `frontend/src/posapp/stores/` Pinia stores for normalized app state
- `posawesome/posawesome/api/` backend APIs split by domain (invoice_processing, item_processing, payment_processing)

---

### TypeScript Migration Status

The POS frontend has been migrated to TypeScript. If you add new modules, prefer `.ts`/`.vue` with `lang="ts"` and keep types in `frontend/src/posapp/types/`.

---

### Returns & Discounts (Important Behavior)

- **Return invoices** use negative quantities and negative totals.
- **Additional Discount (Percentage)** is recalculated automatically based on the current return total.
- **Additional Discount (Amount)** is **prorated** on partial returns.
- Applied as a **negative** discount on returns.
- For **Return without Invoice**, discount logic depends on the POS Profile and may require manual adjustment.

---

### Payments & Write-Offs

- Write-off amount is capped by POS Profile and validated against payment coverage.
- Refunds/returns use negative payment amounts.
- Partial payments and credit sales respect the same write-off limits.

---

### Offline Mode

- Invoices, customers, and payments can be created offline.
- Background sync replays changes when connectivity returns.
- Failed offline submissions are saved as Drafts.

---

### POS Cash Movement (Journal Entry Based)

Use this feature to post shift-level cash expenses and cash deposits from POS App without touching monolithic accounting flows.

#### Usage Notes

- Open POS App and go to `Cash Movement` from the side menu (visible only if enabled in POS Profile).
- Submit `Expense` to book: **Dr Expense Account, Cr POS Cash Account**.
- Submit `Deposit` to book: **Dr Back Office Cash Account, Cr POS Cash Account**.
- Entries are saved as `POS Cash Movement` and linked to a submitted `Journal Entry`.
- History supports:
  - Submitted/Cancelled/Draft filters
  - Expense/Deposit filters
  - Journal Entry reference visibility
  - Cancel action (profile-controlled)
  - Delete action for cancelled records (profile-controlled)

#### Admin Configuration (POS Profile)

Configure these fields in `POS Profile`:

- `Enable Cash Movement`
- `Allow POS Expense`
- `Allow Cash Deposit`
- `Default POS Expense Account`
- `Back Office Cash Account`
- `Allow Cancel Submitted Cash Movement`
- `Allow Delete Cancelled Cash Movement`
- `Require Cash Movement Remarks`
- `Cash Movement Max Amount`

Recommended setup:

- Set a dedicated `Cash` mode of payment and map it correctly at company level.
- Set `Default POS Expense Account` and `Back Office Cash Account` before enabling user access.
- Enable cancel/delete only for trusted operational roles.

#### Offline + Sync Behavior

- Cash movements queue locally when POS is offline.
- Sync runs from:
  - Main sync action in POS layout
  - Manual sync button in Cash Movement screen when queue exists
- Duplicate-safe replay uses `client_request_id` idempotency.

#### Closing Shift Impact

- Submitted cash movements are included in shift overview.
- Expected cash on hand is reduced by submitted cash movement total.
- Closing screen shows a dedicated submitted cash movement summary.

#### Known Limitations / Guardrails

- Backend permissioned runtime tests require a full Frappe/ERPNext bench environment.
- Cash movement amounts are currently reconciled in company currency for closing impact.
- If profile flags are disabled mid-shift, creation and management actions are blocked by backend checks.

For deployment details, see `CASH_MOVEMENT_ROLLOUT.md`.

### Debugging (Quick Tips)

- Check browser console for errors and attached logs with issue for better debugging.
- If UI totals look stale after a major update, clear site data from developer tools and browser cache and files from browsing history.

### Electron Desktop App

Use the bundled Electron shell when you need an offline-friendly desktop build that remembers the ERPNext server URL.

1. **Install dependencies** (root): `yarn install`
2. **Run the desktop shell**: `yarn electron:dev`
3. **Build installers**: `yarn electron:build`

Notes:

- The app prompts for the server URL on first launch (the `/app/posapp` path is added automatically) and saves it locally so you do not need to re-enter it.
- If connectivity drops, an offline screen appears with options to retry or change the saved server.
- Windows (`.exe`) builds require Wine/Mono when running `electron-builder` on Linux. By default, `yarn electron:build` targets the current platform and writes artifacts into `dist-electron/`.
